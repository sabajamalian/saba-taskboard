|--------|----------|
| Architecture, system design, code review, technical decisions | Ripley |
| Flask, API, database, SQLite, OAuth, authentication, Telegram bot | Dallas |
| JavaScript, HTML, CSS, UI, frontend components, forms | Lambert |
| Tests, testing, QA, edge cases, validation | Kane |
| Diagrams, Mermaid, visualization, architecture diagrams, flowcharts | Parker |
| Azure, deployment, DevOps, infrastructure, CI/CD, scripts | Brett |
| Session logging, decisions, memory | Scribe |

## Multi-Domain Tasks

| Task Type | Primary | Support |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Full feature implementation | Ripley (design) → Dallas + Lambert (implement) → Kane (test) |
| API endpoint + UI | Dallas + Lambert (parallel) → Kane |
| New architecture | Parker (diagrams) → Ripley (review) → Team |
| Deployment setup | Brett → Ripley (review) |

## Decision Gate

**All architectural, feature, and UI decisions MUST be presented to Saba for approval before proceeding.**
